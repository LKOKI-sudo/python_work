# Description: A simple program to demonstrate looping through a list of numbers and printing messages.

# Creating a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 4
for value in range(1, 5):
    print(value)

# printing a blank line after the loop
print (f"\n")

# now lets print from 1 to 5
for value in range (1, 6) :
    print (value)

# printing a blank line after the loop
print (f"\n")

# using the range() to make a list of numbers
numbers = list (range (1,6))
print (numbers)
